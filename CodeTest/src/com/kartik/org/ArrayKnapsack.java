 * It should be noted that the above function computes the same subproblems again and again. See the following recursion tree, K(1, 1) is being evaluated twice. Time complexity of this naive recursive solution is exponential (2^n).

In the following recursion tree, K() refers to knapSack().  The two 
parameters indicated in the following recursion tree are n and W.  
The recursion tree is for following sample inputs.
