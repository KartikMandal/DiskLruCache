/**
 * 
 * Find the maximum continuous product in an array
 * An array can have positive and negative elements in it. We have to find a subset of contiguous elements 
 * in the array whose sum is the maximum. Let the maximum continuous sum be represented as MCS
 * 
 * In the brute force approach, we pick an element and then go on adding its right neighbors one by one to find 
 * the maximum contiguous sum starting at that element. We then repeat the process for all elements in the array 
 * to find the MCS across all elements. The time complexity of the brute force approach is O(n2).
 * 
 * However it is possible to find the MCS in O(n) time using kadane’s algorithm. This algorithm works for all cases
 *  (including the case where all the elements are negative). We maintain the variable max_local which will store 
 *  
 *  the sum of the neighboring elements in the current window. The algorithm is described below:
 *  
 *  1. Choose the first element and initialize max_local to the first element.
 *  
 *  2. Traverse through the remaining elements. If the result of adding max_local to the current element is 
 *  greater than current element, then add the current element to max_local and keep continuing the window. 
 *  If however the result of adding max_local to the current element is less than the current element, then 
 *  start a fresh window that starts at the current element and initialize max_local to the current element.
 *  
 *  3. The maximum value of max_local across all elements will be the MCS of the array.
 *  
 *  Let A = {4, -9, 5, 6 , 1} . max_local is initialized to 4. The remaining calculations are shown in the table below
