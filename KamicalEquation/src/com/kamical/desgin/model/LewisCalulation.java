	 * Step 0: We need to figure out what type of compound
	 * Step 0 1: Name the metal (the cation) as it appers on the peroid table.
	 * Step 0 2:Find the polyatomic ion on the common ion table and write the name.
	 * Step 1: Find out the total number of valence electrons.
	 * Step 2: Convert to  pair electrons.
	 * Step 3: Put the least electro negative atom in center.
	 * Step 4: Put two electron in atoms to form a chemical bond.
	 * Step 5: Complete octets on the out side atoms.
	 * Step 6: If central atoms does not have an octet, and move electrons from outer atoms to forms double or triple bonds.
	 * 
	 * Step 3 I: The atom with fewer valance electron form the centerl structure like (C,N,Al,Sc etc)
	 * Step 3 II: Highly electronegative tend to cluster around central atom
	 * Step 3 III: moluclues perefer a compact structrure rather than  chain structure 
	 * Step 3 IV: avoid a seperation of formal charges.
	 * Step 3 V: Find out polarized(C-O   here Oxigen have more electronegative from Carbon)  or non-polarized(C-C  both are carbon so both have same electronegative) situations because  have
